# Core-Type (Channel) Induction Furnace — Interactive Page

This is a small, self-contained web project that explains the core-type (channel) induction furnace, with an embedded diagram, an I²R power calculator, and a comparison table versus coreless furnaces.

## Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click on Windows).
2. Ensure you have an internet connection for the Mermaid diagram library.

## Features

- Overview and principle of operation (transformer analogy, I²R heating)
- Construction and operational aspects (molten heel, stirring, pinch effect)
- Mermaid diagram showing core, primary coil, and molten channel loop
- I²R calculator (I in kA, R in micro-ohms → P in kW)
- Comparison table: core-type vs coreless

## Notes

- Power factor and efficiency are contextual; values vary by size, duty (melting vs holding), and lining condition.
- The calculator is illustrative and does not account for thermal/transfer losses.
